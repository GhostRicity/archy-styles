My life is not perfect and had a lot of ups and downs, especially in 2020. However, somehow I remained happy and I am feeling “happier” than others.

I believe in positive energy and to create such a thing in everyday life I have my day-to-day hacks.

It all comes from us, what we feel, how we feel. What emotions we are sending out to the universe and how do we manage everything.

I believe that our intentions create our reality and our thoughts are energy. So here are a few things I practice and I want to share with you.

Welcome better days in your life and genuine happiness.

**Practice Gratitude**

Practicing gratitude became part of my life and it is one of the most popular habits among the concept of happiness. When you start practicing gratitude you are starting to notice all the blessings and awareness in your life. It is impossible not to be happy.

You can read more about [gratitude here.](https://www.archystyles.com/gratitude/) We recently wrote a blog about it :)

Keep yourself a journal and practice gratitude. It will change your life.



**You are a priority!**

I love myself, but it took me a long time to understand one thing. Put yourself first so you can be healthy, happy, and stable in order to help others**.** Give back to society

Putting your mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual health first is a must.



**Do good!**

I believe sharing compassion, being kind makes a difference.

Recently I found a baby hedgehog, very hurt and God knows how long he has been laying outside hurt, and no one helped him. He had a plastic bag on top of him and it was luck that my friend saw him.

We wanted to help and we wanted the baby hedgehog to live. We took him to the local vet center but unfortunately, they said that they can not save his life but they can end his suffering. It was but helping the poor innocent hedgehog helped me to understand that I want to continue to do good and I want to be kind.



**Focus and stay present**

Try focusing on the things that are important and make you happy. Why focus on the negative all the time and obsess over things that do not matter.

Focus on yourself and the things that make you happy.

Be present and observe what is happening around you. Do something that will bring a smile to your face and something that will relax you.

Tip: Do some yoga and meditation.



**Don’t let negative emotions take control of you!**

A lot of people have encountered stressful and negative life adversities, but the trick is to develop coping strategies. Learn from previous experiences and see what you can do better in the future and renewappreciation for life. Have the ability to recognize new patterns and gain personal strength and improve relationships with others.



**Learn how to cope with emotions**

It is stated that people are happier when they learn how to understand their emotions. Knowing yourself and your emotions make you more aware and bring happiness,.aAhealthier lifestyle, and fast recovery from traumatic events.

Write down what is going on inside your head in an everyday journal!



**Be determined**

Having a great idea? Good write it down, and start working on it! Now is the time for this to happen. Seeing your progress and success will create happiness for you. 

Start Now.

Hope my tips for a more happy mind are helpful and that it will change your way of finding joy in life!

Love,

G
