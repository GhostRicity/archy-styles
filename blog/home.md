The last eight years I have spent Christmas and New Years in different parts of the world. I did not go back home. For many of you that might be an awful thing to do, being away from your family on this sacred religious holiday. But I have always been a free spirit, a curious person who wants to try and explore everything. That is why I have been picking different exotic locations for spending the holidays in the last few years. There is something fascinating about seeing how other cultures, people celebrate the birth of Christ.

As we all know, Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus and it has become one of the biggest celebrations worldwide which incorporate many pre-Christian and Pagan traditions into a festivity.

I have always loved Christmas and the joy it brings to everyone. When I was little I used to sit in front of my window in the middle of the night and watch the snow falling down in the peaceful night, covering in white the sleeping world. My favourite thing to do around Christmas was definitely decorating the Christmas Tree together with my family. Also drinking hot chocolate, eating cookies and watching Christmas movies - my favourite being Home Alone.

Sometimes, I miss being a child with no worries but convincing my parents to let me go play on a cold day with my friends. I loved to go slide in the snow, fight with snowballs and build a snowman with my best friends. I know that these are normal things to do in the wintertime but they are more meaningful than most people realise.

Even though I left my beautiful country and my lovely town, I have always tried to respect and follow our traditions. For every big holiday, I would make traditional food according to the occasion and honour it with close friends. I believe that it doesnâ€™t matter where you are in the world as far as you remember your origin and follow the traditions. I know many people that don't do that and start forgetting their inheritance once they settle down abroad.

However, after spending so much time travelling you start appreciating more your roots and home. That is why I decided to go back home and remind myself of all the small important things that matter in life and create new memories with my family and friends.

After all, Christmas is a family holiday! And a magical time of the year where miracles happen!



What is your favourite holiday? What is your favourite thing to do at Christmas time?
