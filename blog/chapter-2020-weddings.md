For the last couple of weeks, I have been a bit stressed.

Why? Well, one of my best friends and my sister are getting married. And their dates are close to each other.

Oh did I mention, I am the maid of honor for both of them. It’s so shocking for me but I am extremely grateful for that chance and it is a huge responsibility. At least for me, it is!

Anyway, I am still nervous and stressed, I have to fly from Denmark to Bulgaria, to see my friends and family, celebrate my best girlfriend and get ready for the next wedding in Germany - my sister!

One thing that still scares me is the Covid-19 situation. I don’t wont to get sick and I want to celebrate with both brides. So it’s tough to keep social distance on this kind of occasion, but I have to manage and make sure I am safe.

Other things I had to plan in Denmark before my trips.

I am having a new roommate who is coming from the USA and he will be here when I am away. We never officially met, only saw each other on camera and we text quite often. I feel I am doing something really brave here, welcoming someone new in my house, without seeing him in person. I was a bit stressed, but now you know, it will be fun to come home after my trips and see a new face in my apartment. Hope for the best!

The next thing I had to do is take care of my baby boy Archer. Unfortunately, he can’t travel with me and I don’t want to put him on 3 flights. It's not fun for the animals. However, I have a very kind friend who loves him and she will take care of him while I am traveling. Very very grateful for her! Have to surprise her with something when I get back.

So what I did is to keep going. I decided to drink a lot of tea, my to-go tea with ginger, honey, and lemon. Some times I added turmeric. The weather was also very sunny and hot, so I spent some days at the beach with my friends and charging my body with vitamin D. Yoga and breathing exercises also helped me a lot but the most important thing that helps me stay strong was Archer and spending as much time as possible with him. I should soon write a store about "How I meet my Cat". I promise kids, it will be a short story.

The next step is to travel and make the best experience ever from this travel. I may say this is the most exciting thing that is going to happen for me this year and it better be good and kind to ME.

Best,Gery
