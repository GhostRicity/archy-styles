It is not just delicious, but also amazing for our body and soul.

I am sure that most of you have heard about the many benefits of drinking hot lemon honey water. I personally started this morning routine by warming water in the kettle, squeeze a lemon and add one spoon of honey. Preferably raw honey.

The reason why I started drinking lemon honey water every morning, was because I wanted to improve my digestive system. And it helped a lot.

However, I read a lot and I found out how actually beneficial it is for you.

It is rich in vitamin C and the lemon juice protects the body from Immune system deficiencies.

It helps you fight infections and acts as a detoxifying agent. Helps with maintaining digestive health.Lemon juice is also very effective at cleansing the liver as it promotes the liver to flush out toxins.

And many more, but since I am not a scientist or alternative medicine expert, here is a [source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/honey-lemon-water#:~:text=Sipping%20on%20a%20hot%20cup,out%E2%80%9D%20toxins%20from%20the%20body.) where you can read about it more and see if this is something for you. But I will definitely recommend it since it helped me so much and I love how it makes me feel every morning.

Love,
