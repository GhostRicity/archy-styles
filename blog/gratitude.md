A long time ago I discovered gratitude (thankfulness). This is an expression of appreciating what one has and it is a recognition of the value we have.

 *\    “Gratitude is an emotion, one that makes a person feel happier.”*



I experienced ups and downs through the years and I wanted to learn how to actually be happy, to find that genuine happiness,and a positive approach to life. I was reading a lot about the law of attraction, positive psychology and I came across gratitude and decided to try and write down in a journal:

*Things that I am grateful for every day and Things that I am grateful for in my life.*

I started to notice the endless benefits of practicing gratitude. By just taking time to notice and reflect upon things that I am thankful for, I started to experience more positive emotions,and I was able to express and feel compassion and kindness.

Every day, there is something new that I am grateful for and thankful for in my life. I am learning how to love, to be thankful, and appreciating the little things out there. It is very easy to forget,the small things we have in life and to focus on the negative parts. It took me a while to learn and control anger and negative emotions, to stop stressing about things that I can't control and  look at the positive side of things.

Taking time for myself and writing down in the journal Things that I am grateful for, really changed everything for me and I wanted to share this with you. However I am not an expert, I am someone who learns by doing research, so  here is a[ link](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier) where you can learn more about gratitude.

I hope this is something for you and you can enjoy it!

Love,
