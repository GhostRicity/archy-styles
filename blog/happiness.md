What is happiness? This is probably one of the most difficult questions someone can ask you. According to Oxford English Dictionary, happiness is the state of being happy. According to Wikipedia, happiness is a mental or emotional state that includes positive or pleasant emotions that are ranging from contentment to intense joy.

If you ask me, happiness is each moment you want to cherish forever. Every time you want to stay in a particular moment and forget about the rest of the world. Those moments are the ones who make us truly happy.

However, happiness is different for everyone. Some people are happy when they have a loving family or a successful career and a stable job. For others happiness is helping individuals or rescuing animals. We can also find happiness in small everyday things we do, like walking in nature, doing exercises, dancing, cooking, having a coffee with a friend, meeting your loved one, spending time with your family etc. That is why it is so difficult to define happiness.

When it comes to me and my happy moments, most of them are definitely connected with travelling. I am sincerely happy when I have the chance to go and explore some new places. I love seeing nature, learning about history and culture, trying local food and drinks, and meeting native people.

Throughout my life I have been travelling a lot and to be honest it doesn’t get any less exciting. Often my friends are asking me when I will stop travelling and settle down once and for all. My answer has always been the same, why would I stop doing something that makes me truly happy. Happiness doesn’t come your way so often, so when it does the best thing to do is appreciate and enjoy it.

I believe that we should find what brings happiness in our life and stick to it. Never sacrifice it for anyone or anything because after all we live once and life without happiness is an unfilled and empty life.

What is happiness for you? What makes you happy?
