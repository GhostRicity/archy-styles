Previously, I shared my morning hacks routine, and chia pudding was one of my suggestions for easy breakfast in the morning. Here you can read all about it:



My chia pudding recipe is easy and simple to make. It only takes 2 minutes to prep and it “cooks” itself overnight in the fridge. Then in the morning you can grab your jar and add your favorite toppings such as nuts, berries, coconut flakes, seeds(pumpkin, hemp, sunflower) and you are good to go.



What is Chia Pudding?



Chia seeds are tiny black seeds that expand up to 9 times their original size. The pudding is a mix of chia seeds and usually any kind of milk you prefer and you can sweeten it with maple syrup, honey, vanilla sugar, or agave syrup. Once you let the ingredients sit overnight, it becomes a delicious pudding.



Chia pudding is considered a healthy snack, due to its healthy omega-3 fatty acids, protein, fiber, antioxidants, and calcium.



Here is the recipe.

Ingredients:

* ¾ cup of all kinds of milk
* 1 tbsp maple syrup or honey
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 3 tbsp chia seeds
* Nuts, berries, fruits, seed

How to make it:

* In a jar or any other glass container add milk, maple syrup, vanilla, and chia seeds.
* Stir well with a spoon or fork, let it sit for 1 minute and stir again. This will prevent lumps. Then refrigerate overnight.
* When ready to eat, stir well and top with favorite toppings.

Hope you will enjoy it.
