I love using everyday ingredients to create affordable masks and scrubs. I have struggled to find the right products for my skin, from facemasks to face creams and scrubs. Between the weather, the junk food, and the hard water, my skin was not always happy.

Then I did a research and I came across the mask from green tea, honey, and lemon, a little 15 minutes spa treatment for you.

DIY Green tea mask is easy, you just have to mix a teaspoon of green tea with a spoon of honey and a bit of lemon squeeze. Apply on the skin and leave it to rest at least 10-15 minutes. Then wash with warm water.

The green tea helps cleansing and toning of the skin. It helps to prevent blackheads and the honey is a natural moisturizer, which provides glow to the skin. The lemon juice benefits the skin with its natural vitamin C and antioxidant that may help reduce skin damage.
