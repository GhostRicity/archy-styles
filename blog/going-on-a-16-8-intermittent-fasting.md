Hello, my lovelies,

It is time again for a new Blog post. This time I would like to talk about Intermittent Fasting, a very popular new way to lose the extra weight and bring your metabolism back on track.

I am like every other woman out there, ready to try something new in order to achieve a better figure. Funny enough, recently I haven’t been very quick to try new Diets, out of fear I will do it wrong and damage my digestive system. Intermittent Fasting was not on my radar until my Naturopath ( I am still believing in normal medicine and have a GP ), to whom I got sent as an alternative check on my health, suggested I try it out.

You should know about me, that I have been in a constant fight with my digestive track for over 5 years now. I have my good periods and my not so good ones. I have been trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be careful about what I eat. Ok, so back to the topic at hand, Intermittent Fasting. Now, I mean it is something new and the word “fasting” freaked me out. I am not someone who has ever fasted in her life and I wasn’t sure I would manage to do it this time. I am a very curious person by nature, so I started a conversation with the nurse there and asked her about it (she was amazing and understanding). She suggested I start with 14:10 and build to 16:8.

Ok, for those of you who are not familiar with Intermittent Fasting, you need to know that there are different variations on how to do it. Intermittent Fasting is a way to schedule your intake of food and has several methods of implementation. When I talk about 14:10, I am referring to fasting in a cycle of 14 hours, where you do not consume any calories (water, tea, black coffee, and broth are permitted but should be consumed unsweetened) and the 10 is the hour window for eating. The same goes for the 16:8 method, but your fasting window increases by 2 hours and eating decreases by 2 hours. During this time it is important to eat healthy and avoid junk food.

I am not an expert in this field and I am not suggesting you go and do Intermittent Fasting, I am only sharing my personal experience with it. If you would like to give it a try, please talk to your physician about it.

So I started my first week with the 14:10 method and it was a huge adjustment for me. I do like to have breakfast in the morning and my body was not happy with me. After a few days passed, it adjusted itself well and the hunger I was feeling disappeared. Going on my second week, I changed to the 16:8 method. Again it took time for my body to adjust to everything. I actually have a friend who was doing Intermittent Fasting, so I asked her how it is, what benefits she sees, and how she manages. It was really good to get her perspective on the topic as well. She also recommended to me the App for tracking my Fasting called Zero. It is a great App and I am happy with it. There are plenty of others so feel free to check out what suits you best. I also got the AppYAZIOto track my calories. I originally got the App to help me reach a goal of weight loss. By doing the Fasting, I was told I should eat the same amount I normally do. So in my case, it was between 1600 to 2000 calories. My first meal of the day was at 12 PM and my last meal until 08 PM.

I did  Intermittent Fasting from May until September this year. I loved the feeling it gave me and I think my digestive track loved it too. I lost weight but not a drastic change. In August I noticed that the hunger was coming back in the morning, so I discussed it with my naturopath and I decided to stop the fasting. Listen to what your body tells you! Mine clearly said, “It’s enough now!”. The period was great since I was getting married at the beginning of September, plus Honeymoon in Sicily, I didn’t want to restrict myself and not enjoy the amazing food.

And here we are, it’s December and I am starting the Intermittent Fasting again! In the beginning of November, I noticed that I wasn’t feeling like having breakfast but out of habit I did. What happened was that I started to have the acid again. Those who experience it know how unpleasant that can be. It was a clear sign for me that I should maybe avoid breakfast again so why not start fasting again until Christmas.

I am on day 5 and I feel great! As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, please talk to a physician if you would like to do the fasting and consult. Listen to what your body tells you. This is not for everyone. Do your research before you undertake something like that.

I will keep you updated on my progress and inform you of the changes that happen. I will also share with you ideas for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, that you can try out.

Love,

N
