For many people, Friday means the end of the week and the beginning of the weekend. The night that everyone has been waiting to let loose. Entering a bar on a Friday night, you see so many people. All nicely dressed, smiling, and cheering up with full glasses. Some are there to spend time with friends or lovers, others to forget about the daily problems, and some hope to find love.

Is the bar the best place to find love? Many would say no. I agree to a certain level because bars are associated with lots of drinking and one night stands. However, that is not always the case.

We live in a century where online dating is taking over. It is much easier to talk to and meet people than before. You can find a Friday Night date with just a few swipes and there is nothing wrong with that.

However, I think that we have forgotten that as human beings we need real life connection and interactions. We are forgetting how to be sensitive, how to show emotions, share feelings and build connections with others. We are becoming more like robots. All closed down in our own bubble, trying to live the best life.

But where are the human interactions, don’t we lose the social touch? Don’t we forget how to talk to each other while sitting in the same room? Don’t we forget how to flirt with someone we just laid eyes on and liked? I say we do.

So back to the question, is the bar the right place to find love.? I do not know but I believe it is the right place to start getting back the real human interactions. And if you are lucky enough you might even find the love of your life there, no matter if you met them there or they were your Tinder date.
