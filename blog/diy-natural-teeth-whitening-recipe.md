There are many reasons why our teeth lose their bright white sparkle over time. Certain foods and drinks can stain your enamel and cause plaque build-up.

I personally have never been to the dentist’s office to get my teeth whitened chemically or with another painful procedure. So I decided to do a natural teeth whitening solution with coconut oil, turmeric and baking soda.

I have talked about turmeric before and it is full of benefits. Here is yet another use of the spice/root.



**How to prepare your natural teeth whitening recipe.**

**You will need:**

½ cup of coconut oil

1 tablespoon ground turmeric

1 teaspoon baking soda

Add all your ingredients to a small jar and mix until combined well. Brush your teeth as you normally do with toothpaste, after that use a separate toothbrush and take a bit of the mixture onto the brush and start brushing with it for one minute. Spit and rinse :)

P.S**

Make sure you don’t use a white towel because turmeric can leave a color stain.
