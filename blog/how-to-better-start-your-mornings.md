Often our mornings are very hatching with so many things do to before going to work. I used to get stressed sometimes, knowing how many things I had to organize before leaving the house. But I managed to find my way of being well prepared. Here are some of my morning hacks that will make your life easier.

I think I am a bit of a planning freak but who isn’t.



**Hack number 1: Plan your outfit you want to wear the next morning!**

That’s my favorite thing to do. I usually check on the weather forecast to see how the weather is going to be, so I know what I can wear. I leave in Denmark, so It often rains, and I like to be prepared for that. Don’t want my favorite shoes or jacket, or even my hair to get wet and damaged. So I plan my outfit the night before by checking whats the weather is going to be like. Then I put my clothes on a hanger and it is ready!



**Hack number 2: Prepare your breakfast and lunch the night before.**

It is also my favorite thing to do. I am a foodie and I love me a good breakfast and lunch. It is also a good way to save some money. For those who have free lunch at work, well lucky you.

Some ideas for breakfast: You can make chia pudding. It is very healthy and full of omega 3.

You can find my recipe on my blog page

**Ideas for breakfast:**

Boiled eggs and avocado sandwich

Carrots and Cucumbers.

Watermelon!

Banana bread or just bananas.



**Ideas for lunch:**

Well, I usually make a delicious dinner and leave some for me to have for lunch. But if you have finished everything.

Just try to see what’s in your fridge that you can take with you the next day and put it in a lunch box. That way you won’t throw food away, you will decrease food waste and be sustainable.



**Hach number 3: Pack your gym back or work bag or both.**

Hach number 4: Get up 10 minutes earlier and meditate.** 

I use Headspace as my meditation guide! Highly recommended.

Stretch and make yourself a warm beverage. Mine is lemon honey water - read more about it on my blog page.



**Hach number 5: Before you go to sleep make a mental or physical checklist for your plan for the next days.**

**\
Hack number 6: Love your animal**

I adore my cat Archer! Knowing I will be gone for 7 hours breaks my heart, but for that matter, I do wake up a bit earlier, so I can feed him, play with him and cuddle him before I leave. Also making sure he has everything he needs while I am gone.



**Hack number 7: My favorite number. Gratitude.**

I do a small prayer in the morning. Positive thoughts and I am ready to kick start my day with a smile.

Hope my morning hacks, will help you and will make you a little bit better at organizing your day!

Love, 

Gery!
