Very recently I experienced a breakup and that really broke my heart. I tried so many things not to feel the pain and it did work but at the same time it is still there.

All the emotions I experienced and anxieties, I couldn't breathe and I felt claustrophobic while people were close to me or wanting to be close to me and that terrified me to death.

It is a bit funny because I am not a heartbreak coach or therapist for that matter, but I have experienced multiple times a heartbreak scenario, and the thought of getting my heart broken again scares me.

What happens when you Allow your pain …?**

I have a tendency to close myself and suppress my emotions. To put on a smile and just enjoy my life. That is how I trick my brain to think that I am ready for more adventures, meeting new people, and so on, but the smallest thing can trigger me and I can fall apart.

It is easy to numb the pain by watching Netflix, eating pizza, and going out.

Side effects of heartbreak are loss of appetite, pain in your freaking chest every time you think about him/her moving on with someone else. The desire to just sleep longer so your days of pain will be shorter. It is the worst feeling.

And that happened to me and what I tried to do this time is to Allow My Pain.

I allowed myself to feel sad and broken.



**Another side effect of heartbreak is - self-sabotage!**

I looked for problems and I acted like a child around my closest friends. Instead of saying to myself and being happy that I am on track with my life and that the things I am doing are falling into places, I was just sabotaging everything with my behavior.

I realized that my brain was the one creating all the suffering. Managing your thoughts is so important and they are the ones that helps us create whatever results we want and how we are healing ourselves.

So my healing process started by allowing my pain to come out.

I cried, I ate junk food while crying on my sofa, I watched romantic movies and felt sorry for myself...

My brain was like “he doesn’t deserve you”

“You wasted your time” … Just building more negative emotions such as anger and I was getting so mad at my brain.

I said to myself “This is ridiculous” I am fine, and it is normal to feel sad after a breakup.

It is normal to have negative thoughts, you just have to learn not to pay attention to every single emotion that comes out.

As always, my medicine was Yoga and Meditation. Just getting back on track with that, made my life easier.

Focusing on myself and my thoughts put me in a better place. After all, we are humans, that experience hundreds of emotions daily, but strengthening the relationship we have with ourselves, can help us be more welcoming to the pain.

“Healthy mind, healthy body and sleep”

Love,
