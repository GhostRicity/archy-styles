Starting the day with a positive mind and having a calm, relaxed morning, is everything. I love my mornings, where I wake up and stretch my body, wash my face, and brush my teeth and make fresh coffee.

By nature, I am a planning freak, and having a routine and doing it, it’s my way to feel That I am on track with myself and my life.

This 2020 has been the most unpredictable year for most people and I bet that still is very confusing as it is for me.

Before, my mornings were different, especially when I was a full-time worker. And I built up a morning routine that helped me reduce stress and be organized.

I already talked about it, and it’s our very first blog post “How to better start your mornings “ -[Check it out here](https://www.archystyles.com/how-to-better-start-your-mornings/)

Things changed and during the lockdown, my mental health was not really balanced for a long time, so the lockdown didn’t help to improve it. I decided that I will stay strong and I will improve myself.

Every morning, I would wake up around 7:00 am or 7:30 am, and that is because of my cat. He was already trained that breakfast is between that time slot. So he would keep me on track with how long I would actually sleep.

Waking up in the morning and doing yoga for 30 to 40 minutes every day and doing 10 minutes of meditation was my key to balance my life and my mental health. It was also such a great habit to build up. It really helped me to be more energized, happier, and grateful.

Unfortunately, my routine changed again, because more responsibilities came into my life.

Now as I keep saying to my family and friends - “I am modern now, I work from home. I am a remote worker”.

Honestly in the beginning it was not as fun as I thought or comfortable. You see, my home is my place where I can relax, and feel safe and stressless.

Suddenly, I had to plan. Okay, when do I get up so I can have time for my morning yoga, for my meditation, for my coffee, for reading the news, for playing with my cat. And I felt overwhelmed.

Remote working was new to me and my job was new to me. So I thought “Okay, I got to plan this sh*t, so I don’t stress out as much”. No one likes stress and stress is not good for anyone.

Now my morning routine consists of me getting up as early as 2 hours before my work.

I do morning yoga max 30 min.

I play with my cat

I make quick breakfast -( Baked oatmeal is the best one or chia pudding) - quick and easy

I send my intentions to the universe and I give thanks.

Somehow, no matter that I stay most of my time at home, and I spend most of my day in front of a computer, this small routine really helps me out. I am not perfect, nor I am happy 24/7. I have my bad days, especially when the wintertime hit in Scandinavia. But about “How to deal with the dark winter days?” another time!

Advice from me! Try to find time to do something you love before you get into your work mood. I am not a morning person, but I actually enjoy it now more than anything. The quiet time and the non-computer starting part.

Remember to be kind to yourself, and treat others with kindness.

Love, G
