Things are never easy and life can be very difficult at times. Stress is part of our way of life and the best way to learn how to live with it is to lay back and try our best to relax.

I personally had and still, experience stress and anxieties. It really affected my way of working, communicating with people, my health was not on point and so many other negative feelings.

However, I did some research and I decided to take things in my own hands and try to detox from stress. I will share some of the activities that help me be less stressed and more happy and relaxed.
