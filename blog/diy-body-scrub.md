A couple of years ago I was living with a girl who was vegan and had a bit of a problem with her skin. She introduced me to her homemade body scrub with coconut oil and coffee. And I got hooked.

Reading a bit more about the scrub and its benefits I found out that this scrub helps alleviate cellulite and it’s a natural exfoliant.

Coffee grounds help to exfoliate and energize skin appearance due to caffeine content.

Thanks to the coconut oil your skin is moisture after it’s washed off.



**Here is how to prepare:**

**Ingredients:**

\* 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds (use fresh coffee grounds)

\* 1 tablespoon coconut oil

In a glass bowl mix all the ingredients. Use the mixture to scrub your face and body. Let it sit for 1-15 minutes. Wash it off in the shower.



Enjoy it!

Love, G
