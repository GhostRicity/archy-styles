It’s again this time of the year… The cold weather, the rainy days… All we want to do is cuddle on the sofa with hot cocoa or tea under a blanket and watch the new episode of our favourite TV show.

It is one of my favourite seasons, with its beautiful colours and carpets made of leaves. It is also pumpkin time! I love pumpkin and all the different delicious meals I can make from it.

Did you know that pumpkins are very healthy and contain a number of different Vitamins? Yes my darlings, pumpkins contain potassium and beta-carotene (converts into Vitamin A). It also contains minerals such as calcium and magnesium as well as Vitamin C, E and some of the B Vitamins.

As I mentioned above, I enjoy cooking with pumpkin. Here I am sharing a recipe for a salad that contains Hokkaido pumpkin. It is easy to prepare and on top of it is delicious.

I hope you enjoy it! Let me know what you think about it.



**Quinoa salad with pumpkin (2 Portions)**

**Ingredients**

1 cup of Quinoa (I usually use a coffee cup for 2 portions)

300 gr Cucumber

1 Tomato

14 Black olives

½ yellow Paprika

¼ Hokkaido Pumpkin

2 Eggs (optional)

50 gr Feta



**For the seasoning:**

Olive Oil

Bio apple vinegar

Salt, Pepper



**Preparation:**

1. Rinse the Quinoa and put in a pot and add double the amount of water to the amount of Quinoa. So by 1 cup Quinoa, I will put 2 cups of water. Let it get to boiling after that reduce the heat and cover it for 10 minutes. Take it off the stove and let it cool off. If you are planning on doing this recipe I will suggest you pre-cook the Quinoa the night before.
2. Preheat your oven on 200 C by circulating air. Prepare your Pumpkin. Cut it in slices, put it on a baking tray and season it with Olive oil, salt and Pepper (I also add a bit cinnamon to mine). Bake it for around 30 to 40 minutes depending on how strong your oven is. Halfway turn it over.
3. Dice your Cucumber, Tomato and Paprika into small cups. The olives I cup into circles but you can do it just the way you like.
4. When everything is ready to mix the Quinoa with the veggies, add Olive oil, Apple vinegar, Salt and Pepper. Crumbler the Feta on your portion and add your fried Egg (if you used one) as well as your Pumpkin on the side. Enjoy!
