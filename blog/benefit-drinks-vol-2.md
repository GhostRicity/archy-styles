It is a simple answer, ginger, honey & turmeric.

During the Corona outbreak, more and more people are waking up to the idea of overall health and immunity and I have noticed, a lot used multivitamins and kept active with sports.

I choose a more alternative and sure way to do that, is by making ginger and turmeric tea with honey. Ginger and turmeric are two types of flowering plants that are widely used in natural medicine.



**Benefits of Ginger**

Ginger is a traditional remedy of indigestion, flatulence, and bloating. Ginger is also packed with anti-inflammatory properties. Including ginger in your warm drinks could help give you clearer throat and nasal passages.



**Benefits of Turmeric**

Turmeric's active component curcumin may do wonders for your overall health. The rich antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the spice is good for immunity, skin, and digestion.



**Benefits of Honey**

Honey is a natural cough suppressant. It is loaded with antibacterial and antiviral properties that help ease symptoms of cold, cough, and flu. It is also a natural energy-booster and incredibly heart-friendly food.



**How to make turmeric, ginger, honey tea?**

Take a cup full of water, add an inch fresh root of ginger, a teaspoon of turmeric, and bring it to boil. Let it steep for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat. Strain and serve.

Now, add honey for taste.



I hope this is something you would enjoy!
