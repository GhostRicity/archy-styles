Black coffee in the morning is my friend, who wakes me up and tones me. Coffee is found to be good for memory and has a large number of antioxidants. Also, we can use it for aesthetic purposes.

Caffeine has long been the most important ingredient in anti-cellulite creams because it frees tissues from excess water and limits fat deposits. Its lifting effect makes it useful for bags under the eyes. And that's not all!

I use coffee grounds to make my homemade mask. My skin is sensitive, so I am very careful about what products I use and what I apply on my face. But coffee grounds, have made my skin very happy and I will share my recipe.



**Mask with coffee grounds for delicate facial skin**

• 1 tbsp. coffee grounds

• 1 tbsp. Almond oil

• 1 tbsp. honey



Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Apply on the face, avoiding the eye contour. Leave the mask on for 10 minutes. Rinse with lukewarm water.
