We live in a modern world, where everyone has a chance to follow their dreams. Travelling, studying and working in different countries and continents is easier than ever now. This is why many people decide to leave their homes in search of better opportunities in education, work or other areas of their lives. However, by doing that, they have to make significant life changes.

I know many people who are scared of changing even the smallest thing in their everyday life. I am aware that change can be scary because it involves new and unknown experiences- but what is life without them. Embracing change is an important aspect of life and we should be happy when it comes our way. Otherwise, we risk getting stuck in our comfort zone and missing out on so many wonderful things.

Why am I telling you this? Well, change has been a constant part of my life, and I have learnt not just how to embrace it, but to even seek it out and take full advantage of it.



I left my country when I was 19 years old to study abroad, and since then I have made many changes in my life, including living in several countries. I still remember the moment I set foot on foreign land for the first time and realised that this was going to be the beginning of a new chapter of my life. A whole new adventure to be taken advantage of, every single moment enjoyed- no matter the circumstances.

Once you start taking risks, stop worrying about the unknown and accepting the opportunities life brings you, I have no doubt that life will suddenly become less stressful and way more enjoyable.

I wonâ€™t lie, it is not an easy thing. But truth be told? It's worth it.

What are your thoughts on change? Is it a positive or negative thing?

Love,D
