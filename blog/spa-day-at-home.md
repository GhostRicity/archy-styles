Lately, I am all about self-care days. And I am always trying to find a day that I just dedicate to me, myself, and I. I love to treat myself with beauty hacks I do at home, play my favorite music, dance around the house, and just be grateful.

Here are some of my Spa Day treatments I do at home.

*Face***

First, I clean my face with my cleanser from Garnier SkinCare Pure Active 2in1 with zinc and salicylic acid.

I rinse with water and then I have a face massage. That’s the best thing you can do for your face! Massaging is the most natural way to lift, tone, and sculpt the muscle tissues of your face and neck.



***Face Mask***

YES and yes. Face masks are the best! I usually start with my “The Body Shop” face mask - Japanese Matcha tea. It is a pollution clearing mask that really makes my skin feel soft. I usually leave it on for a max of 10 minutes.



***Body Scrub***

My go-to-body scrub is my homemade scrub with Coconut oil and Coffee. The scrub helps

alleviate cellulite and it’s a natural exfoliant for the skin.

***Lip Scrub***

If you haven’t tried lip scrub yet now is the time to do so. My favorite one is  Coconut oil, honey, and brown sugar. The scrub helps you to exfoliate your lips and leaves them to look and feel healthy and smooth. It is great for the cold weather since our lips tend to break.

P.S. Try it before you apply your favorite Lipstick ;)

***Mani/Pedi***

It is always a good idea to treat yourself at home with some manicure and pedicure. I love looking at some pictures online and get inspired by what I want on my nails. But if this is not something you like to do, I know a great gal that does amazing nails :P.



**Remember!**

Having time for yourself is important. That is the first step for taking care of yourself. Next, try to find time for you and only you.

Have a wonderful SPA DAY at Home by ArchyStyles.
