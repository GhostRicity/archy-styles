You probably wonder, why am I doing so many DIY stuff, and why do I love coconut oil so much. Well here is why?

This next DIY is one of my favorite because is for your lips and it tastes and smells amazing.

We often struggled with dry lips, especially during winter but it can happen during summer too. We know we need to hydrate our lips but how about exfoliating them?

Exfoliating your lips help them to be healthy and smooth. The lip scrub helps to slough off dead skin and helps the lip balm to reach deeper into your skin. The result is for you to have healthier lips without spending money on expensive scrubs when you can make it at home!

Here is how to make your DIY Lip Scrub**

Ingredients:

* 1 tablespoon coconut oil
* 1 tablespoon organic honey
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar

(you can add ½ tablespoon water or a bit of the melted coconut oil)



Mix the coconut oil and the honey. After adding the brown sugar and water or the oil to the mixture. Rub the mixture on your lips with a circular motion for two to three minutes and then rinse with water.

The coconut oil is filled with antioxidants and helps to nourish the skin, while the brown sugar acts as a natural exfoliator that helps to remove dead and dry skin. Honey is rich in natural healing properties.



**How to store your natural lip scrub?**

Put your lip scrub into a glass container with a lid. Label the jar and add the date you made it so you can keep track of how long you have had it. Homemade cosmetics don’t last long, but this particular lip scrub can last for two weeks if you keep it in the refrigerator.

Hope you will enjoy it!

P.S - Don’t eat your scrub, it tastes amazing but is not made for eating.
