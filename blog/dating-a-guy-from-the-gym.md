Have you ever dated that hot guy from the gym? The one with high self-confidence because he knows he is sexy as hell and all of the girls are melting over him. Yes, that one. I believe you got the image.

A few years ago, I was going to a different gym and there were many hot guys. But one of them stood out of the others. He was tall with beautiful blue eyes. He was in great shape with six-packs and everything. I could see that all of the girls were trying to talk to him, that is why I decided to ignore him.

However, after several days in the gym, he started to smile at me every time I would pass. So, I decided to ask him some stupid questions regarding some exercises. He was more than happy to answer my questions. After we spoke for a while it turned out that he was a personal trainer and bodybuilder. He offered me to have a one-time session with him to show me some exercises. I agreed to do it but by the end of the training, I regretted it deeply. I was feeling I was about to die of exhaustion.

Several days later, he invited me for dinner at his place and I accepted. When I arrived at his apartment he was cooking chicken with rice and preparing his meals for the next day. It was clear that he is into a healthy lifestyle because of his hobbies, which was cool. We had dinner, I had two glasses of wine, he didn’t drink at all. We just made out that night. I left his place with the idea that I found someone to match within the bed.

I decided to meet him for the second time because of the strong attraction we shared. I went to his place again, we spoke but he was too tired and wanted to lay down in bed. I thought that was his way of getting me into his bed, so cheeky. He laid down wearing only boxers. I removed my dress and left only my lingerie on. I laid next to him, we were kissing and it seemed we were about to reach third base… but it didn't happen. Apparently, he was too tired to even try to have sex.

There is no need to say that I was quite disappointed and shocked. I understand that he was tired but why inviting me to come over and luring me into his bed when he knew he is too tired to have sex…I still don’t see the logic behind…but I do know that it was clear as a day how horny he was in these moments…

Anyway, I never saw him again but at the end of the day, it was a fun experience.

Have you ever experienced a similar situation?

Love, D
