Hello my lovelies! 

Here is a new delicious recipe for you. This time we will be pulling our sleeves up and preparing to make something for those who enjoy a great cake.

I, myself, am not a great baker. I have to admit that, but my hubby enjoys something sweet from time to time. So for his special day (his birthday), I made his wish come true and baked his favorite cake! I do a very healthy one usually if I decide to bake but he wanted just like his mum does. Therefore I contacted my mother-in-law to ask how she does it. Let me tell you, I find it to have too much sugar but hey it’s his birthday!

I try to apply a more healthy food routine at home for us both so normally I add honey to my sweets instead of refined sugar (Agave syrup is also a good option). At the end of the day, it depends on how much sweetness you enjoy really.

But let me not delay it any further my lovelies. Here is the recipe for the Carrot cake.

**\
Carrot Cake**

**Ingredients:**

400 gr of carrots (grated)

250gr Flour (I used a whole grain but it is up to you really)

2 tsp. Baking powder

250g Sugar (so my mother-in-law said she used less than this, like 150gr instead) I made it with the full amount and I found the cake to be too sweet so maybe less is not that bad ;)

1 tsp. Cinnamon

250 ml Oil (neutral) I took only 200 ml last time and it still worked great

4 Eggs

250 gr Almonds (fine ground) If you cannot find them ready like that just use your Mixed to ground them yourself

Fett for the form ( I used a plant-based butter for it )

**\
For the Frosting:**

300 gr Cream cheese

100 gr Powder sugar

1 Pack Vanilla Sugar

1 splash of Lemon juice ( I use bio so that I can grate the peel and use it at the end )

**\
Preparation:**

1. In a bowl add the eggs, sugar, oil, and cinnamon and mix them together with your Mixer. After that add the grated carrots and your almonds. To the flour add your baking powder and mix them well and add them to the other mixture and stir everything good. After you are done, pour the batter in your 26er springform pan that you have fitted before so you will not get the cake to stick to the sides. Put it in the oven at a temperature of 180 °C Upper and bottom heat for the duration of 40 - 50 minutes. You should also use a toothpick to test how the cake is doing. Usually, we all know how good our ovens work so we can estimate generally how long our cake will take. After the cake is done leave it in its baking form to cool down. You can start your preparation for the frosting.

2. The cream cheese and the splash of Lemon are added in a bowl, with the mixer of a low level stirred until smooth. Add the powder and vanilla sugar gradually to the mixture.

3. After your cake has cooled down with the help of a palette knife, the frosting should be applied all around. Voila! Ready to eat!

Love,
